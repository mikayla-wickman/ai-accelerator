Hey Claude, I'm writing a one-pager today and I need it to be really great and really solid.

For me, a one-pager is a clear and tight articulation of the problem we're solving—establishing not only that it's a real problem, but that it's a problem worth solving because there's real customer pain. Customer pain at scale. And there's customer and business value if we can solve it.

Today I'm writing a one-pager about custom fields, and I want you to partner with me to write it together.

I also want you to push me—poke holes, challenge me, help me make it better.

Before we dig in, let me orient you to what I have:

Resources:

- Insights brief:
  ~/dev/reports/custom-fields/insights_brief.md

- Full research findings:
  ~/dev/reports/custom-fields/research-findings.md

- One-pager template:
  https://housecall.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PM/pages/1738703352/Template+Project+Title+1+Pager
  (use the Atlassian MCP to access this)

- Plus:
  Access to Snowflake, competitive research, and other internal tools if we need them

Start by familiarizing yourself with all of this. Once you've digested everything and you're ready, come back to me and we can get started.
