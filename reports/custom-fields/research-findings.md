## Top 10 Customer Quotes (Verbatim - High Relevance)

1. **HIGH - Feature Request / Need**
   > "I can't believe there's no way to add it my own field custom field to a form it's like so basic"

2. **HIGH - Pain Point / Blocker**
   > "I created a Trade partner lead form and would like to customize it some, but it seems that my choices are very limited unlike the link to Book now on our website that takes you to HCP"

3. **HIGH - Feature Request / Blocking Issue**
   > "Hi do you have a feature or field for customer PO's. That won't pay unless the po is on the invoice"

4. **HIGH - Pain Point / Workflow Impact**
   > "Hello, I would like to know if it's possible to add a field to our jobs where we could add a PO number?"

5. **HIGH - Feature Request / Business Critical**
   > "Gabriel, What I need is a PO Field on HCP, That field should be alpha numeric, but understanding different Pros, we should have the option to Create some extra personalized Fields, to get more control of our Customer and be able to identify better some specific scenarios"

6. **HIGH - Functionality Gap**
   > "I just started with MAX, and I was wondering how I could add custom fields to my customers to track things like Meta Pixel ID and GCLID."

7. **HIGH - Pain Point / Configuration Blocker**
   > "Hello. Is there a way to customize the drop down menu in Property Profile? For instance, we don't need BBQ, Can I take that out?"

8. **HIGH - Feature Request / Critical Business Need**
   > "Adjusting dropdown menus. Property items have every industry in it. Would like to customize it to the few things that we actually install. Let us remove the toaster and other things we don't need and add fireplace, HRV, and things that we install. If we were to filter through the property profile a majority of it is other."

9. **HIGH - Pain Point / Mandatory Field Problem**
   > "can i set job fields to be mandatory field to fill out when creating a new job?"

10. **HIGH - Workflow Automation Issue**
    > "I just want to make sure that you're understanding what I'm looking for. We're not trying to create something for the customer; this would simply be custom forms that are viewed on our side of things. The checklist add-on is very limited, and those forms only attached to the job itself not the customer or the property. So if I was looking for notes on a job from 10 years ago, I might be swiping through 10 years of visits before I find the one that has that note in the checklist. Does that make sense?"

## Field Types Supported (Planned)
- **Phase 1:** Select/Dropdown (user-defined options)
- **Phase 2+:** Text, Number, Date, Boolean, Multi-select

## Objects in Scope

- **Phase 2+:** Jobs, Estimates, Invoices, Quotes, Service Agreements

## Core Use Cases Identified (Internal)
1. **Churn Reason** (dropdown) - Reportable, critical for retention analysis
2. **Gate Code** (text/number) - Deferred to Phase 2
3. **Time Preference** (dropdown) - Scheduling optimization
4. **Lead Source Detail** (text/dropdown) - Marketing ROI analysis
5. **Non-booking Reason** (dropdown) - Conversion funnel analysis

## Known Gaps/Future Work
- API access for custom fields
- Advanced search capabilities
- Conditional field visibility based on business logic

# SECTION 4: SYNTHESIS & GAPS

## Alignment: VOC vs Internal Planning

### Strong Alignment ✅
- **Dropdown fields** needed (VOC Theme 2 + Internal Phase 1)
- **Multi-object support** needed (VOC Themes 1,4,5 + Internal Phase 3)
- **Churn tracking** (Internal use case matches VOC need for retention data)

### Gaps Between VOC and Planning ⚠️

1. **PO Number Fields (VOC #1 Priority)**
   - VOC: 12+ mentions, BLOCKING business operations
   - Internal Plan: Not mentioned in core use cases
   - **Gap:** Text/number fields deferred to Phase 2, but PO is critical for contractors billing large clients

2. **Required Field Enforcement (VOC Theme 3)**
   - VOC: 15+ mentions for data quality enforcement
   - Internal Plan: Listed in "Known Gaps/Future Work"
   - **Gap:** Not planned for Phase 1 or 2

3. **Lead Form Customization (VOC Theme 4)**
   - VOC: 20+ mentions, sales team blocker
   - Internal Plan: Lead Source Detail mentioned, but not lead form field flexibility
   - **Gap:** Form-level customization not in scope

4. **Dropdown Management - Remove Options (VOC Theme 8)**
   - VOC: 15+ mentions, users want to REMOVE irrelevant system options
   - Internal Plan: Focus on adding custom options
   - **Gap:** Ability to hide/remove default system values not mentioned

5. **Property Profile Customization (VOC #2 Priority)**
   - VOC: 25+ mentions, major HVAC/service company pain
   - Internal Plan: Properties not mentioned in Phase 1-3 scope
   - **Gap:** Property-level custom fields missing from roadmap

## Competitive Gaps

### Features Competitors Offer That Are Missing from Plan
1. **Client-facing visibility toggle** (Jobber) - Internal vs external field display
2. **Conditional logic/auto-tagging** (ServiceTitan) - Automation based on field values
3. **Transferable fields** (Jobber) - Automatic data flow from parent to child objects
4. **Field-level permissions** (ServiceTitan) - Who can view/edit specific fields

### Features Plan Includes That Competitors Lack
- **Franchise/Command & Control integration** - Template account management (unique to our multi-franchise model)
